# llamadart_litert_lm_flutter

Flutter Apple Swift Package Manager companion package for
[`llamadart`](https://pub.dev/packages/llamadart) `.litertlm` / LiteRT-LM
support.

Add the package to a Flutter iOS app when it should link the prebuilt LiteRT-LM
Apple XCFrameworks through SwiftPM instead of relying on the core package's
native-assets fallback. The manifest includes the complete macOS target set,
but llamadart's Flutter macOS hook path currently keeps the core native-assets
runtime fallback.

```yaml
dependencies:
  llamadart: ^0.8.18
  llamadart_litert_lm_flutter: ^0.0.8
```

This package has no runtime Dart API of its own. Import `package:llamadart`
normally from the core package and use `LlamaBackend()` / `LlamaEngine` there.

The Apple SwiftPM manifest pins `leehack/litert-lm-native@v0.15.0-native.3`.

Source for this package lives in
`packages/llamadart_litert_lm_flutter` in the
[`llamadart`](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart) repository.
